1. Differentiate between Data Mining and Model Based Optimization.
Data Mining is about analysing the data, making points, and correlations between the data. Model - based optimization is making the model that is capable of  generating those points  in fine mannaer between those point from Data mining. 
2. How is Model-based Automated Software Engineering(MASE) different from traditional SE?
Traditional software engineering is about making service that meet the requirements.
MASE is about automating the process of software engineering. It is less about making services and and more about the search. Its goal is discovering interesting features in exissting models also may be the evolution of entirely new kinds of models.
