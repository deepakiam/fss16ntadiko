1. Differentiate between Data Mining and Model Based Optimization.

Data Mining is about analysing the data, making points, and correlations between the data. Model - based optimization is making the model that is capable of  generating those points  in fine manner even between those point from Data mining. 

2. How is Model-based Automated Software Engineering(MASE) different from traditional SE?

Traditional software engineering is about making service that meet the requirements.
MASE is about automating the process of software engineering. It is less about making services and and more about the search. Its goal is discovering interesting features in existing models also may be the evolution of entirely new kinds of models.

3. Give an example of multi objective optimization.

The Cellular Network Service Providers have multiple objectives, such as provide good data rate, less cost of data, good Quality of service, more subscriptions, good profits. To achieve these, there are several decisions the operators have to make. If the operator provides good QoS, but cost are not at par with competetitors, then operator is likely to make less profits due to less subscriptions. And similarly, if the cost of plans are cheap bu the Qos is poor , he faces same situtation. The operator has t make optimized decision to meet this custmer and business needs.
